        <p> 
        I am currently a Ph.D student at TIMC-IMAG, in Grenoble (France). I work in the field of statistics in population genetics. I graduated from the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure de Cachan (France) with a major in Mathematics. I have a particular interest in understanding how mathematics can contribute to solving real world problems and that led me to enroll in a Masters in Mathematics Applied to Biology. I have had the chance to work on diverse subjects (shape analysis, image segmentation, population genetics) and in different contexts (Chinese University of Hong Kong, CMLA, General Electric Healthcare, TIMC-IMAG), making all these experiences unique and very enriching. And as coding has become central in applied mathematics, I have taken advantage of these internships to develop good computational skills (R, C++, Python). I am looking for a new challenge where mathematics, coding, biology and data science fit together.
